## Optimizations
I solved at least one challenges everyday. Naturally, this mean I also commit to this repository everyday. Committing to this repository require almost the same steps everyday which I have automated most of it by using a Python script I made called **[POLF](https://github.com/fn-r/polf)**

## Lesson Learned
What I found after completing one challenges, allowed me to see solutions made by others too. This gave me more insight on other ways to solve a problem, come across new methods and understanding on how to tackle a challenge.

Not being able to solved one challenge is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve yourself.
